## Setup

### üîß Installing VideoDB in your environment

VideoDB is available as

[python package üì¶](https://pypi.org/project/videodb)

!pip install videodb

### üîó Setting Up a connection to db

To connect to VideoDB, simply get the API and create a connection. This can be done by either providing your VideoDB API key directly to the constructor or by setting the VIDEO\_DB\_API\_KEY environment variable with your API key.

Get your API key from

[VideoDB Console](https://console.videodb.io/)

. ( Free for first 50 uploads, No credit card required ) üéâ

import videodb

conn = videodb.connect(api\_key="YOUR\_API\_KEY")

## Working with Single Video

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading a video

Now that you have established a connection to VideoDB, you can upload your videos using conn.upload()

You can upload your media by a url or from your local file system

upload method returns a Video object.

\# Upload a video by url

video = conn.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDv4AWk0J3U")

\# Upload a video from file system

video\_f = conn.upload(file\_path="./my\_video.mp4")

VideoDB simplifies your upload by supporting links from Youtube, S3 or any Public URL with video

### Pro Tip

If you wish to upload only the audio from a video file, just specify in the "media\_type" field. For instance, you can obtain audio from a YouTube video by doing so.

from videodb import MediaType

audio = conn.upload(url="https://youtu.be/IoDVfXFq5cU?si=BCU7ghvqY3YdCS78", media\_type=MediaType.audio)

The types of media that can be uploaded are defined in the MediaType class.

### üì∫ Viewing your video

Your video is instantly available for viewing 720p resolution ‚ö°Ô∏è

Generate a streamable url for video using video.generate\_stream()

Preview the video using video.play(). This will open the video in your default browser/notebook

video.generate\_stream()

video.play()

Note: if you are viewing this notebook on github, you won't be able to see iframe player, because of security restrictions. Please open the printed link of player in your browser

### ‚õìÔ∏è Stream Specific Sections of videos

You can easily clip specific sections of a video by passing timelineof start and end sections. It accepts seconds. For example Here‚Äôs we are streaming only first 10 seconds and then 120 to 140 second of a video

stream\_link = video.generate\_stream(timeline=\[(0,10),(120,140)\])

play\_stream(stream\_link)

### üóÇÔ∏è Indexing a Video

To search bits inside a video, you have to first index the video. This can be done by a invoking the index function on the video object. VideoDB offers two type of indexes currently.

index\_spoken\_words: Indexes spoken words in the video. It automatically generate the transcript and makes it ready for search. Checkout

[Language Support](https://docs.videodb.io/language-support-79)

to index different language content.

index\_scenes: Indexes visual concepts and events of the video. Perfect for building security monitoring, drone, and other camera footage. Refer

[Visual Search and Indexing](https://docs.videodb.io/visual-search-and-indexing-80)

Checkout

[Multimodal Search](https://docs.videodb.io/multimodal-search-90)

for unlocking multimodal search in your video library.

‚è±Ô∏è Indexing may take some time for longer videos, structure it as a batch job with callback in your application. Check

[Callback Details](https://docs.videodb.io/callback-details-66)

\# best for podcasts, elearning, news, etc.

video.index\_spoken\_words()

\# best for camera feeds, moderation usecases etc.

video.index\_scenes(prompt="<your prompt to describe the scenes>")

Upcoming:

Real time feed indexing, setting up real time alerts.

Specific domain Indexes like Football, Baseball, Drone footage, Cricket etc.

### üîç Search Inside a Video

Search the segments inside a video. While searching you have options to choose the type of search and index. VideoDB offers following types of search :

SearchType.semanticPerfect for question answer kind of queries. This is also the default type of search.

SearchType.keywordIt matches the exact occurrence of word or sentence you pass in the query parameter of the search function. keyword search is only available to use with single videos.

IndexType.sceneIt search the visual information of the video, Index the video using index\_scenesfunction.

IndexType.spoken\_wordIt search the spoken information of the video, Index the video using index\_spoken\_wordsfunction.

from videodb import SearchType

from videodb import IndexType

result = video.search(query ="What are the benefits of morning sunlight?",

search\_type =SearchType.semantic,

index\_type =IndexType.spoken\_word)

result.play()

Viewing Search Results :

video.search() will return a SearchResults object, which contains the sections/shots of videos which semantically match your search query

result.get\_shots()\- Returns a list of Shot that matched search query

result.play()\- Returns a playable url for video (similar to video.play() you can open this link in browser, or embed it into your website using iframe)

## RAG: Search Inside Multiple Videos

VideoDBcan store and search inside multiple videos with ease. By default, videos are uploaded to your default collection and you have freedom to create and manage more collections, checkout our

[Collections](https://docs.videodb.io/collections-68)

doc for more details.

If you are an existing llamaIndex user, trying to build RAG pipeline on your video data. You can also use VideoDB retriever. Checkout llama docs ‚¨áÔ∏è

üîÑ Using Collection to upload multiple Videos

\# Get the default collection

coll = conn.get\_collection()

\# Upload Videos to a collection

coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY")

coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ4kOr38JhY")

coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak\_dXHh6s4")

conn.get\_collection() : Returns Collection object, the default collection

coll.get\_videos() : Returns list of Video, all videos in collections

coll.get\_video(video\_id): Returns Video, respective video object from given video\_id

coll.delete\_video(video\_id): Deletes the video from Collection

### üìÇ Search inside multiple videos in a collection

You can simply index all the videos in a collection and use search method on collection to find relevant results. Here we are indexing spoken content of a collection and searching

\# Index all videos in collection

for video in coll.get\_videos():

video.index\_spoken\_words()

Semantic Search in the collection

\# search in the collection of videos

results = coll.search(query ="What is Dopamine?")

results.play()

Let‚Äôs try one more search:

results = coll.search(query = "What's the benefit of morning sunlight?")

results.play()

The result here has all the matching bits in a single video stream from your collection. You can use these results in your application right away.

As you can see VideoDB fundamentally removes the limitation of files and gives you power to access and stream videos in a seamless way. Stay tuned for exciting features in our upcoming version and keep building awesome stuff with VideoDB ü§ò

## üåü Explore more with Video object

There are multiple methods available on a Video Object, that can be helpful for your use-case.

### Access Transcript

\# get text of the spoken content

text\_json = video.get\_transcript()

text = video.get\_transcript\_text()

print(text)

Add Subtitle to a video
