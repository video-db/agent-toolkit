## Setup
---

### üì¶ Install VideoDB

Install the VideoDB package using pip:

```python
!pip install -U videodb
```

### üîë  Set your API Key

```python
import os

# Replace with your actual API key
os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxx-yyyyy-zzzz"
```

### üåê Connect to VideoDB

```python
from videodb import connect

conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
```

### üé• Upload a Video

Upload a video to your VideoDB collection. Here, we're using a YouTube URL for demonstration:

```python
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LejnTJL173Y")
```

## üìá Index Scenes
---

The `index_scenes` function analyzes your video and creates an index of its visual content.

```python
index_id = video.index_scenes()
```

### Optional Parameters for Customization

The `index_scenes()` function offers several optional parameters for fine-tuning the indexing process:

*   **`extraction_type`**:  Choose the scene extraction algorithm (e.g., time-based, content-based).
*   **`extraction_config`**: Configure the chosen extraction algorithm (e.g., specify time intervals for time-based extraction).
*   **`prompt`**: Use a prompt to guide the vision model in describing scenes and frames. This allows you to tailor the descriptions to your specific needs.

For more detailed information on Scene and Frame objects, see [Advanced Visual Search](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/video/scene-index/advanced_visual_search.ipynb).

```python
from videodb import SceneExtractionType, IndexType

index_id = video.index_scenes(
    extraction_type=SceneExtractionType.time_based,
    extraction_config={"time": 10, "select_frames": ['first']},
    prompt="describe the image in 100 words",
)

# Wait for indexing to finish and retrieve the scene index
scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
scene_index
```

```output
[{'description': 'The image depicts a man sitting in an office or conference room, characterized by the presence of glass windows with blinds behind him. He is wearing a dark suit, a white dress shirt, and a dark striped tie. The man appears to be contemplative, with his eyes closed or looking down, and a slight smile on his face. The background shows a bright, well-lit room with natural light filtering through the windows. The atmosphere seems professional and formal, suggesting a workplace or corporate environment. The man‚Äôs bald head and expression give an impression of a moment of reflection or contentment.',
  'end': 10.01,
  'start': 0.0},
 {'description': 'The image shows a man with a receding hairline, wearing a dark suit, light blue shirt, and dark striped tie. He appears to be seated, with a neutral or slightly contemplative expression on his face. Behind him, there are large office windows with horizontal blinds partially closed, through which an indistinct office environment is visible. The lighting is soft, creating a professional atmosphere. The man‚Äôs posture suggests he could be engaged in a conversation or in thought, possibly in a workplace setting. The overall mood seems formal and reflective, indicating a business or serious context.',
  'end': 20.02,
  'start': 10.01},
  ... # Output truncated for brevity
 ]
```

> **Note:** Allow 5-10 seconds for the index to become available for searching after creation.

Now, search your video using the `index_id`.

```python
res = video.search(query="religious gathering",
                  index_type=IndexType.scene,
                  index_id=index_id)

res.play()
```

This will return a URL to play the video, highlighting the sections that match your search query.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scene Index Parameters

Here's a breakdown of the parameters for the `index_scenes` function:

*   **`extraction_type`**: Determines the algorithm used to identify and extract scenes from the video.
*   **`extraction_config`**: Provides specific settings for the chosen `extraction_type`.
*   **`prompt`**:  A text prompt that guides the vision model in describing each scene. This allows you to focus on specific content or activities.
*   **`callback_url`**: (Optional) A URL to receive a notification when the indexing process is complete.

### Deeper Dive into Parameters

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `extraction_type` & `extraction_config`

Videos are essentially sequences of images. The `extraction_type` and `extraction_config` parameters let you control how these images are analyzed and grouped into scenes. Experiment with different algorithms to identify the most relevant frames for describing your videos. See the [Scene Extraction Algorithms documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/scene-extraction-algorithms-84) for more details.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/main/images/scene_index/VSF.png)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `prompt`

The `prompt` parameter is crucial for guiding the vision model and tailoring the generated descriptions. For example, to identify running activity:

> "Describe clearly what is happening in the video. Add `running_detected` if you see a person running."

To experiment with your own models and prompts, check out [Advanced Visual Search Pipelines](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/scene-index/advanced_visual_search.ipynb).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `callback_url`

The `callback_url` allows you to receive asynchronous notifications when the indexing job is finished. See the [callback details documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/callback-details-66#_lubHL) for more information.

<div style="height:40px;"></div>

## üóÇÔ∏è Managing Indexes
---

> üí° Create multiple scene indexes for a single video and rank search results based on relevance for your users.

**List all scene indexes for a video:**

The `video.list_scene_index()` method returns a list of available scene indexes, including their `id`, `name`, and `status`.

```python
scene_indexes = video.list_scene_index()
print(scene_indexes)
```

```output
[{'name': 'Scene Index 2024-07-22 10:06', 'scene_index_id': 'f4db35c5ce45a709', 'status': 'done'}]
```

**Get a specific index:**

The `video.get_scene_index()` method retrieves a specific scene index based on its `scene_index_id`, providing details like `start`, `end`, and `description` for each scene.

```python
scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
print(scene_index)
```

```output
[{'description': 'The image depicts a man sitting in an office or conference room, characterized by the presence of glass windows with blinds behind him. He is wearing a dark suit, a white dress shirt, and a dark striped tie. The man appears to be contemplative, with his eyes closed or looking down, and a slight smile on his face. The background shows a bright, well-lit room with natural light filtering through the windows. The atmosphere seems professional and formal, suggesting a workplace or corporate environment. The man‚Äôs bald head and expression give an impression of a moment of reflection or contentment.', 'end': 10.01, 'start': 0.0}, {'description': 'The image shows a man with a receding hairline, wearing a dark suit, light blue shirt, and dark striped tie.

The lighting is soft, creating a professional atmosphere. The man‚Äôs posture suggests he could be engaged in a conversation or in thought, possibly in a workplace setting. The overall mood seems formal and reflective, indicating a business or serious context.', 'end': 20.02, 'start': 10.01}, ... ]
```

**Delete an index:**

```python
video.delete_scene_index(index_id)
```

This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to [VideoDB](https://videodb.io), a platform for indexing, searching, and streaming video content. You'll learn how to upload videos, generate streamable URLs, perform semantic and keyword searches, and integrate VideoDB into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

<div style="height:40px;"></div>

### Setup
---

#### üîß Install VideoDB

Install the VideoDB Python package using pip:

```python
!pip install -U videodb
```

#### üîë Connect to VideoDB

Establish a connection to VideoDB using your API key. You can either pass the API key directly or set it as the `VIDEO_DB_API_KEY` environment variable.

> üí° Get your API key from the [VideoDB Console](https://console.videodb.io). (Free for the first 50 uploads, no credit card required!) üéâ

```python
from videodb import connect, play_stream

# Replace with your API key
conn = connect(api_key="sk-xxx-yyyyy-zzzz")
```

<div style="height:40px;"></div>

### Working with a Single Video
---

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload a Video

Upload a video using `conn.upload()`. You can upload from a public URL or a local file path. The `upload` function returns a `Video` object, which provides access to various video methods.

```python
# Upload a video by URL
video = conn.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU0PYcCsL6o")
```

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
VideoDB simplifies uploads by supporting links from YouTube, S3, or any public URL with video content.
</div>

#### üì∫ View Your Video

Videos are instantly available for viewing at 720p resolution.

*   Generate a streamable URL using `video.generate_stream()`.
*   Preview the video in your browser/notebook using `video.play()`.

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If viewing this notebook on GitHub, the embedded player might not work due to security restrictions. Please open the printed URL in your browser to view the video.
</div>

```python
video.generate_stream()
video.play()
```

```text

```

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è Get Specific Video Sections

Clip specific sections of a video by providing a timeline of start and end times (in seconds) to `video.generate_stream()`.

For example, the following streams only the first 10 seconds and then seconds 120 to 140 of the uploaded video:

```python
stream_link = video.generate_stream(timeline=[[0, 10], [120, 140]])
play_stream(stream_link)
```

```text
'https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/d0a049ff-be6e-41f7-826e-4a6e411f7bab.m3u8'
```

#### üîç Indexing a Video

To enable search within a video, you must first index it. VideoDB currently offers two types of indexes:

1.  `index_spoken_words`: Indexes spoken words within the video and automatically generates a searchable transcript. Supports 20+ languages. See [Language Support](https://docs.videodb.io/language-support-79) for more information.
2.  `index_scenes`: Indexes visual information and events in the video, enabling you to find specific scenes, activities, objects, or emotions. Refer to the [Scene Index Documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/scene-index-documentation-80) for details.

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing may take time, especially for longer videos.
</div>

```python
# Index spoken content of the video
video.index_spoken_words()
```

```

#### üîé Search Inside a Video

Search indexed videos using `video.search()`. Available search types and indexes include:

*   `SearchType.semantic`: For question-answering-style queries (default).
*   `SearchType.keyword`: For exact word or sentence matching (only available for single videos).
*   `IndexType.scene`: Search visual information (requires `index_scenes`).
*   `IndexType.spoken_word`: Search spoken content (requires `index_spoken_words`).

```python
from videodb import SearchType, IndexType

result = video.search(query="what's the dream?", search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.spoken_word)
result.play()
```

```text
'https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/de284dc9-1aa9-440b-b407-b8fc5aa07273.m3u8'
```

```python
# Try with different queries
query = "mountains"

result = video.search(query=query, search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.scene)
result.play()
```

```text
'https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/72baa6ff-2758-49bb-b8d6-237f44e4b6c1.m3u8'
```

##### üì∫ View Search Results

`video.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object containing sections/shots semantically matching your query:

*   `result.get_shots()`: Returns a list of `Shot` objects that matched the search query.
*   `result.play()`: Opens the video in your browser/notebook, highlighting the relevant segments.

##### üóëÔ∏è Cleanup

Delete the video from VideoDB using `video.delete()`:

```python
video.delete()
```

<div style="height:40px;"></div>

## RAG: Working with Multiple Videos
---

`VideoDB` simplifies storing and searching across multiple videos. By default, videos are uploaded to your default collection. You can create and manage multiple collections. See our [Collections documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/collections-68) for details.

If you're using LlamaIndex to build RAG pipelines on your video data, leverage the VideoDB retriever. See [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/videodb_retriever.html).

#### üîÑ Uploading Multiple Videos to a Collection

```python
# Get the default collection
coll = conn.get_collection()

# Upload videos to the collection
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY")
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ4kOr38JhY")
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak_dXHh6s4")
```

```text
Video(id=m-6d1b1bf6-a2ba-4786-a3a8-8efbabfee28c, collection_id=c-a2dc1100-1faa-4394-803c-ca808da09c47, stream_url=https://d27qzqw9ehjjni.cloudfront.net/v3/published/manifests/4e41464d-0ca6-40da-86f7-3e803ff8d840.m3u8, player_url=https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://d27qzqw9ehjjni.cloudfront.net/v3/published/manifests/4e41464d-0ca6-40da-86f7-3e803ff8d840.m3u8, name=AMA #3: Adaptogens, Fasting & Fertility, Bluetooth/EMF Risks, Cognitive Load Limits & More, description=None, thumbnail_url=None, length=1921.2193)
```

Collection methods:

*   `conn.get_collection()`: Returns the default `Collection` object.
*   `coll.get_videos()`: Returns a list of `Video` objects within the collection.
*   `coll.get_video(video_id)`: Returns a specific `Video` object by its ID.
*   `coll.delete_video(video_id)`: Deletes a video from the collection.

### üìÇ Searching Across Multiple Videos in a Collection

Index all videos in a collection and use the `search` method to find relevant results. Here, we index the spoken content for a quick demonstration.

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing can take time, particularly for longer videos.
</div>

```python
# Index the spoken content of each video
for video in coll.get_videos():
    video.index_spoken_words()
    print(f"Indexed {video.name}")
```

```text

```text
- If you awaken from this illusion and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death, or shall I say death implies life, you can feel yourself not as a stranger in the world, not as something here on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. I'm not trying to sell you on this idea in the sense of converting you to it. I want you to play with it. I want you to think of its possibilities. I'm not trying to prove it. I'm just putting it forward as a possibility of life to think about. So then - let's suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream and that you could, for example, have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time or any length of time you wanted to have. And you would naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure conceived. And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say, well, that was pretty great, but now let's. Let's have a surprise. Let's have a dream which isn't under control. Well, something is going to happen to me that I don't know what it's going to be. And you would dig that and come out of that and say, wow, that was a close shave, wasn't it? Then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream. And finally you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of living the life that you are actually living - today. That would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have of playing that you weren't goddesse. Because the whole nature of the godhead, according to this idea, is to play that hes not. So in this idea, then, everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality. Not God in a politically kingly sense, but God in the sense of being the self, the deep down basic whatever there is. And you're all that, only you're pretending you're - nothing. -
```

#### Access Visual Scene Descriptions

```python
video.get_scene_index(index_id)

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/nb/main/guides/video/Subtitle.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

This guide demonstrates how to customize subtitle styles using the `SubtitleStyle` class in VideoDB. You'll see visual examples of different configurations, covering:

*   **Typography and Style:** Font, size, spacing, and text styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough).
*   **Color and Effects:** Text, outline, and background colors with transparency.
*   **Positioning and Margins:** Alignment and margins for optimal placement.
*   **Text Transformation:** Scaling and rotation of the subtitle text.
*   **Borders and Shadow:** Adding borders and shadows for enhanced readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### üì¶ Installing the VideoDB Package

```python
%pip install videodb
```

### üîë API Key

You'll need a VideoDB API key to proceed.

> Get your API key from the [VideoDB Console](https://console.videodb.io). (Free for the first 50 uploads, no credit card required! üéâ)

```python
import os
os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = ""
```

### üåê Connecting to VideoDB

```python
from videodb import connect

conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
```

### üé• Uploading a Video

Upload a base video to which we'll add subtitles. We'll use this example video for the guide.

```python
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il39Ks4mV9g")
video.play()
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can also upload videos from your local file system by providing the `file_path` to the `upload()` method.

## üîä Indexing Spoken Words

Before adding subtitles, index the video's spoken words using `video.index_spoken_words()`. This generates the necessary transcript for the subtitles.

```python
video.index_spoken_words()
```

```

```

## üìù Adding Default Subtitles

The simplest way to add subtitles is using `Video.add_subtitle()`. This will generate subtitles with default styling.

The method returns a streaming URL which can be played using `play_stream()`.

```python
from videodb import play_stream

# Add subtitles to the video
stream_url = video.add_subtitle()

# Play the stream with subtitles
play_stream(stream_url)
```

## üìù Customizing Subtitle Styles

To customize the appearance of subtitles, pass a `SubtitleStyle()` object with your desired configurations to the `Video.add_subtitle()` method.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Refer to the API Reference for the `SubtitleStyle` class to see all available options.

### 1. Typography and Style

Control the typography of your subtitles using these `SubtitleStyle()` parameters:

*   `font_name`: The font to use (e.g., "Roboto", "Arial").
*   `font_size`: The font size in pixels.
*   `spacing`: Spacing between characters in pixels.
*   `bold`: Set to `True` for bold text.
*   `italic`: Set to `True` for italic text.
*   `underline`: Set to `True` for underlined text.
*   `strike_out`: Set to `True` for strikethrough text.

```python
from videodb import SubtitleStyle

stream_url = video.add_subtitle(
    SubtitleStyle(
        font_name="Roboto",
        font_size=12,
        spacing=0,
        bold=False,
        italic=False,
        underline=False,
        strike_out=False,
    )
)
play_stream(stream_url)
```
