# [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/quickstart/Scene%20Index%20QuickStart.ipynb)

# This guide introduces you to scene indexing, a powerful technique for extracting visual information from videos and making it searchable using VideoDB. Scene indexing leverages vision models to identify key scenes and generate descriptions, enabling you to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for video content.

# Using scene indexing, you can easily build RAG for queries like:
# ![Scene Index Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/main/images/scene_index/intro.png)

# ## Setup

# ### üì¶ Installing packages

```python
!pip install -U videodb
```

# ### üîë API Keys

```python
import os

# Replace with your API key
os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxx-yyyyy-zzzz"
```

# ### üåê Connect to VideoDB

```python
from videodb import connect

conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
```

# ### üé• Upload Video

```python
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LejnTJL173Y")
```

# ## üìá Index Scenes

# The `index_scenes` function analyzes your video and automatically generates scene descriptions.

```python
index_id = video.index_scenes()
```

# ### Optional Parameters

# The `index_scenes()` function accepts optional parameters for customization:

# *   `extraction_type`:  Choose the scene extraction algorithm.
# *   `extraction_config`: Configuration options for the chosen extraction algorithm.
# *   `prompt`: A prompt to guide the vision model in describing the scenes.

# Refer to the [Scene and Frame Object Guide](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/video/scene-index/advanced_visual_search.ipynb) for more details.

```python
from videodb import SceneExtractionType, IndexType

index_id = video.index_scenes(
    extraction_type=SceneExtractionType.time_based,
    extraction_config={"time": 10, "select_frames": ["first"]},
    prompt="describe the image in 100 words",
    # callback_url=callback_url,
)

# Wait for Indexing to finish
scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
scene_index
```

# > Note: It might take an additional 5-10 seconds for your index to become available for searching.

```python
# Search your video with index_id
# Default Case: search all indexes
# query ; "drinking"

res = video.search(
    query="religious gathering", index_type=IndexType.scene, index_id=index_id
)

res.play()
```

# ## ‚öôÔ∏è Index Scenes Parameters

# **`index_scenes` parameters:**

# - `extraction_type`: Choose scene extraction algorithm.

# - `extraction_config`: Configuration of the scene extraction algorithm.

# - `prompt`: Prompt to describe each scene in text.

# - `callback_url`: Notification URL when the job is done.

# Let‚Äôs explore each parameter in detail.

# ### ‚öôÔ∏è `extraction_type` & `extraction_config`

# A video is a series of images. A 60 FPS video displays 60 frames per second and appears higher quality than a 30 FPS video. The `extraction_type` parameter allows you to experiment with different scene extraction algorithms, influencing the selection of frames used to describe the video's details.  See [Scene Extraction Algorithms](https://docs.videodb.io/scene-extraction-algorithms-84) for more.

# ![Visual Search Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/main/images/scene_index/VSF.png)

# ### Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏è `prompt`

# The `prompt` guides the vision model to understand the context and desired output. For example, to identify running activity, you can use the following prompt:

# > "Describe clearly what is happening in the video. Add running_detected if you see a person running.‚Äù

# If you want to experiment with your own models and prompts, see [Advanced Visual Search Pipelines](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/scene-index/advanced_visual_search.ipynb).

# ### ‚öôÔ∏è `callback_url`

# The `callback_url` receives a notification when the scene indexing process is complete. Checkout callback details [here](https://docs.videodb.io/callback-details-66#_lubHL)

# ## üóÇÔ∏è Managing Indexes

# > üí° You can create multiple scene indexes for a video and rank the results after a search before presenting them to your user.

# **List all scene Indexes created with a video:**

# `video.list_scene_index()` returns a list of available scene indexes with `id`, `name`, and `status`.

```python
scene_indexes = video.list_scene_index()
print(scene_indexes)
```

# **Get Specific Index:**

# `video.get_scene_index()` returns a list of indexed scenes with `scene_index_id`, `start`, `end`, and `description`.

```python
scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
print(scene_index)
```

# **Delete an index:**

```python
video.delete_scene_index(index_id)
```

# ## üßë‚Äçüíª Deep Dive

```

**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **Conciseness:** Removed redundant phrases and unnecessary introductory statements.  The original "bluff" text was significantly reduced to focus on direct instructions and explanations.
*   **Clarity:** Replaced ambiguous language with precise terms.  For example, "versatility of scene indexing" was replaced with a direct statement of its purpose: "extracting visual information from videos and making it searchable."
*   **Structure:**  Improved the overall flow and organization by grouping related concepts and using clear headings and subheadings.  The parameter descriptions are now clearly formatted as lists.
*   **Emphasis on Actionable Steps:** Focused on what the user needs to *do* rather than just describing the general idea.
*   **Removed redundant URLs:** Removed the colab and website redirectors.
*   **Removed Output:** The output of code cells, while helpful for debugging in development, isn't necessary for a quickstart guide and makes the notebook harder to read. This makes the notebook easier to follow.

This refined version is a more effective quickstart guide because it's easier to understand, faster to read, and provides clear, actionable steps for the user to follow.

# IPYNB Notebook: scene_level_metadata_indexing [Source Link](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/quickstart/scene_level_metadata_indexing.ipynb)

```python
# üìå VideoDB F1 Race Search Pipeline: Scene Detection & Metadata Filtering

# üéØ Objective
# This notebook demonstrates how to use scene-level metadata filtering in VideoDB to enable precise search and retrieval of moments within an F1 race video.

# üîç Pipeline Overview:
# 1. Upload an F1 race video to VideoDB.
# 2. Extract scenes from the video, capturing a key frame every 2 seconds.
# 3. Describe each scene using AI to generate structured metadata (camera_view & action_type).
# 4. Index the scenes with the generated metadata.
# 5. Search for specific scenes using a combination of semantic search and metadata filtering.

# üì¶ Install VideoDB SDK
# The VideoDB SDK is required to connect to the platform and process video data.
!pip install videodb

# üîë Set Up API Key
# Authenticate with VideoDB using your API key.  This allows access to indexing and search functionalities.
import os
os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = ""

# üåê Connect to VideoDB
# Establish a connection to VideoDB to manage video storage, indexing, and search.
from videodb import connect
conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
print(coll.id)

# üé• Upload F1 Race Video
# Upload the F1 race video to VideoDB for processing.
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-oslsgSaTI")
print(video.id)

# ‚úÇÔ∏è Extracting Scenes (Every 2 Seconds)
# Split the video into 2-second scenes, extracting a single frame from the middle of each scene.
# This granular approach enables precise scene-level filtering.
from videodb import SceneExtractionType

scene_collection = video.extract_scenes(
    extraction_type=SceneExtractionType.time_based,
    extraction_config={"time": 2, "select_frames": ["middle"]},
)

print(f"Scene Collection ID: {scene_collection.id}")

scenes = scene_collection.scenes

print(f"Total Scenes Extracted: {len(scenes)}")

# üîç Generating Scene Metadata
# Use AI to describe and categorize each scene with structured metadata to enable semantic search.

# üìå Scene-Level Metadata Fields:
#  1Ô∏è‚É£ camera_view: Where is the camera placed?
#     - "road_ahead": Driver's POV looking forward.
#     - "helmet_selfie": Close-up of driver's helmet.

#  2Ô∏è‚É£ action_type: What is the driver doing?
#     - "clear_road": No cars ahead (clean lap).
#     - "chasing": Following another car (intense racing moment).

# This metadata facilitates searching for specific race scenarios and, combined with semantic search, makes retrieval highly precise.

from videodb.scene import Scene

# List to store described scenes
described_scenes = []

for scene in scenes:
    print(f"Scene from {scene.start}s to {scene.end}s")

    # Generate metadata
    camera_view = scene.describe(
        'Select ONLY one of these camera views (DO NOT describe it, JUST return the category name): ["road_ahead", "helmet_selfie"]. If the view does not match exactly, pick the closest one.'
    )

    action_type = scene.describe(
        'Select ONLY one of these options based on the action being performed by the driver (DO NOT describe it, JUST return the category name): ["clear_road", "chasing"]. If the view does not match exactly, pick the closest one.'
    )

    scene_description = scene.describe(
        "Clearly describe a Formula 1 scene by specifying the scene type, the drivers and teams involved, the specific location on the track, and the key action or significance of the moment. Use concise, yet rich language, targeting Formula 1 enthusiasts seeking precise scene descriptions."
    )

    print(f"Camera View: {camera_view} | Action Type: {action_type}")
    print(f"Scene Description: {scene_description}")

    # Create Scene object with metadata
    described_scene = Scene(
        video_id=video.id,
        start=scene.start,
        end=scene.end,
        description=scene_description,
        metadata={
            "camera_view": camera_view,
            "action_type": action_type
        }
    )
    described_scenes.append(described_scene)

print(f"Total Scenes Indexed: {len(described_scenes)}")

# üóÇ Indexing Scenes with Metadata
# Index the scenes with the generated metadata to enable efficient and targeted searches.

# Indexing at the scene-level significantly enhances the effectiveness of filtering.
# Instead of searching the entire video, only relevant indexed segments are considered.  This enables powerful filtering by camera view & driver action.
if described_scenes:
    scene_index_id = video.index_scenes(
        scenes=described_scenes,
        name="F1 Scenes"
    )
    print(f"Scenes Indexed under ID: {scene_index_id}")

# üîé Searching Scenes with Metadata & AI
# Search for scenes using a combination of semantic search and metadata filters.

# - Semantic Search: AI understands the meaning of the query.
# - Metadata Filters: Only return relevant scenes based on camera view & action type.

# #### üîç Example 1: Finding Intense Chasing Moments
# Search for scenes where a driver is chasing another car, viewed from the driver's perspective.
from videodb import IndexType
from videodb import SearchType

search_results = video.search(
    query = "A skillful chasing scene",
    filter = [{"camera_view": "road_ahead"}, {"action_type": "chasing"}],   # Using metadata filter
    search_type = SearchType.semantic,
    index_type = IndexType.scene,
    result_threshold = 100,
    scene_index_id = scene_index_id  # Our indexed scenes
)
# Play the search results
search_results.play()

# #### üîç Example 2: Finding Smooth Solo Driving Moments
# Search for scenes with clean, precise turns, where the driver has an open road ahead.
search_results = video.search(
    query = "Smooth turns",
    filter = [{"camera_view": "road_ahead"}, {"action_type": "clear_road"}],   # Using metadata filter
    search_type = SearchType.semantic,
    index_type = IndexType.scene,
    result_threshold = 100,
    scene_index_id = scene_index_id
)
# Play the search results
search_results.play()

# ‚úÖ Conclusion: Precision Search with Scene Metadata
# Scene-level metadata indexing enables:

# - Precise filtering of race footage by camera angles & driver actions.
# - AI-powered semantic search to find specific race moments.
# - Enhanced video retrieval for F1 analysis, highlights, and research.

# üöÄ This approach unlocks smarter, metadata-driven video search‚Äîmaking every second of race footage instantly accessible.
```

# *   Generate a streamable URL using `video.generate_stream()`
# *   Preview the video using `video.play()`. This opens the video in your browser/notebook.

# <div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
#     <strong>Note:</strong> If viewing this notebook on GitHub, the iframe player may not display due to security restrictions. Please open the printed link in your browser.
# </div>

# ```python
# video.generate_stream()
# video.play()
# ```

# #### ‚úÇÔ∏è Get Specific Sections of Videos

# Clip specific sections of a video by providing a timeline (start and end times in seconds) to `video.generate_stream()`.

# Example: Stream the first 10 seconds and then seconds 120-140:

# ```python
# stream_link = video.generate_stream(timeline=[[0,10], [120,140]])
# play_stream(stream_link)
# ```

# #### üîç Indexing a Video

# To enable searching within a video, you first need to index it.  VideoDB currently offers two types of indexing:

# 1.  `index_spoken_words`: Indexes spoken words, automatically generating a transcript for search. Supports 20+ languages.  See [Language Support](https://docs.videodb.io/language-support-79) for details.

# 2.  `index_scenes`: Indexes visual information.  Ideal for finding scenes, activities, objects, and emotions.  Refer to [Scene Index Documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/scene-index-documentation-80) for details.

# <div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
#     <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing may take time, especially for longer videos.
# </div>

# ```python
# # Index spoken content.
# video.index_spoken_words()
# ```

# ```python
# # Index visual information.  Adjust the prompt to suit your use case.
# # You can index a video multiple times with different prompts.
# index_id = video.index_scenes(
#     prompt="Describe the scene in strictly 100 words"
# )

# # Wait for indexing to finish and retrieve scene index.
# scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
# scene_index
# ```

# #### üîç Search inside a video:

# Search indexed videos using `video.search()`.  You can specify the search and index types.  VideoDB supports:

# *   `SearchType.semantic`:  For question-answering-style queries (default).
# *   `SearchType.keyword`:  For exact word/sentence matching (available only for single videos).
# *   `IndexType.scene`: Searches visual information (requires `index_scenes`).
# *   `IndexType.spoken_word`: Searches spoken content (requires `index_spoken_words`).

# ```python
# from videodb import SearchType, IndexType

# result = video.search(query="what's the dream?", search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.spoken_word)
# result.play()
# ```

# ```python
# # Try with different queries
# query = "mountains"

# result = video.search(query=query, search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.scene)
# result.play()
# ```

# ##### üì∫ View Search Results :

# `video.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object containing relevant video sections/shots.

# *   `result.get_shots()`: Returns a list of `Shot` objects that match the search query.
# *   `result.play()`: Opens the video in your browser/notebook, highlighting the matching segments.

# ##### üóëÔ∏è Cleanup
# You can delete the video from the database using `video.delete()`

# ```python
# video.delete()
# ```

# ## RAG: Working with Multiple Videos
# ---

# `VideoDB` can easily store and search across multiple videos. By default, videos are uploaded to your default collection. You can create and manage multiple collections; see our [Collections documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/collections-68) for more details.

# If you're building a RAG pipeline on video data using LlamaIndex, you can use the VideoDB retriever. See [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/videodb_retriever.html).

# #### üîÑ Using Collections to Upload Multiple Videos

# ```python
# # Get the default collection.
# coll = conn.get_collection()

# # Upload videos to the collection.
# coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY")
# coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ4kOr38JhY")
# coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak_dXHh6s4")
# ```

# *   `conn.get_collection()`: Returns the default `Collection` object.
# *   `coll.get_videos()`: Returns a list of `Video` objects in the collection.
# *   `coll.get_video(video_id)`: Returns the `Video` object for the given video ID.
# *   `coll.delete_video(video_id)`: Deletes the video from the collection.

# ### üìÇ Search on Multiple Videos from a Collection

# Index all videos in a collection and then use the `search` method on the collection to find relevant results.

# Indexing the spoken content for a quick experiment:

# <div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
#     <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing may take time, especially for longer videos.
# </div>

# ```python
# # For simplicity, just indexing the spoken content of each video.
# for video in coll.get_videos():
#     video.index_spoken_words()
#     print(f"Indexed {video.name}")
# ```

# ### Search Inside Collection:

# Search a collection using `coll.search()`.

# ```python
# # Search in the collection of videos
# results = coll.search(query = "Deep sleep")
# results.play()
# ```

# ```python
# results = coll.search(query= "What are the benifits of morning sunlight?")
# results.play()
# ```

# ```python
# results = coll.search(query= "What are Adaptogens?")
# results.play()
# ```

# #### üì∫ View Search Results :

# `coll.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object containing relevant video sections/shots.

# *   `result.get_shots()`: Returns a list of `Shot` objects that match the search query.
# *   `result.play()`: Opens the video in your browser/notebook, highlighting the matching segments.

# <div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing may take time, especially for longer videos.
</div>

```python
# Index spoken content.
video.index_spoken_words()
```

```python
# Index visual information. Adjust the prompt to suit your use case.
# You can index a video multiple times with different prompts.
index_id = video.index_scenes(
    prompt="Describe the scene in strictly 100 words"
)

# Wait for indexing to finish and retrieve scene index.
scene_index = video.get_scene_index(index_id)
scene_index
```

#### üîç Search inside a video:

Search indexed videos using `video.search()`. You can specify the search and index types. VideoDB supports:

*   `SearchType.semantic`: For question-answering-style queries (default).
*   `SearchType.keyword`: For exact word/sentence matching (available only for single videos).
*   `IndexType.scene`: Searches visual information (requires `index_scenes`).
*   `IndexType.spoken_word`: Searches spoken content (requires `index_spoken_words`).

```python
from videodb import SearchType, IndexType

result = video.search(query="what's the dream?", search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.spoken_word)
result.play()
```

```python
# Try with different queries
query = "mountains"

result = video.search(query=query, search_type=SearchType.semantic, index_type=IndexType.scene)
result.play()
```

##### üì∫ View Search Results :

`video.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object containing relevant video sections/shots.

*   `result.get_shots()`: Returns a list of `Shot` objects that match the search query.
*   `result.play()`: Opens the video in your browser/notebook, highlighting the matching segments.

##### üóëÔ∏è Cleanup
You can delete the video from the database using `video.delete()`

```python
video.delete()
```

## RAG: Working with Multiple Videos
---

`VideoDB` can easily store and search across multiple videos. By default, videos are uploaded to your default collection. You can create and manage multiple collections; see our [Collections documentation](https://docs.videodb.io/collections-68) for more details.

If you're building a RAG pipeline on video data using LlamaIndex, you can use the VideoDB retriever. See [LlamaIndex documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/retrievers/videodb_retriever.html).

#### üîÑ Using Collections to Upload Multiple Videos

```python
# Get the default collection.
coll = conn.get_collection()

# Upload videos to the collection.
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsODSDmY4CY")
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ4kOr38JhY")
coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak_dXHh6s4")
```

*   `conn.get_collection()`: Returns the default `Collection` object.
*   `coll.get_videos()`: Returns a list of `Video` objects in the collection.
*   `coll.get_video(video_id)`: Returns the `Video` object for the given video ID.
*   `coll.delete_video(video_id)`: Deletes the video from the collection.

### üìÇ Search on Multiple Videos from a Collection

Index all videos in a collection and then use the `search` method on the collection to find relevant results.

Indexing the spoken content for a quick experiment:

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Indexing may take time, especially for longer videos.
</div>

```python
# For simplicity, just indexing the spoken content of each video.
for video in coll.get_videos():
    video.index_spoken_words()
    print(f"Indexed {video.name}")
```

### Search Inside Collection:

Search a collection using `coll.search()`.

```python
# Search in the collection of videos
results = coll.search(query = "Deep sleep")
results.play()
```

```python
results = coll.search(query= "What are the benifits of morning sunlight?")
results.play()
```

```python
results = coll.search(query= "What are Adaptogens?")
results.play()
```

#### üì∫ View Search Results :

`coll.search()` returns a `SearchResults` object containing relevant video sections/shots.

*   `result.get_shots()`: Returns a list of `Shot` objects that match the search query.
*   `result.play()`: Opens the video in your browser/notebook, highlighting the matching segments.

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
VideoDB removes the limitations of traditional file-based video access, giving you seamless access and streaming capabilities. Stay tuned for exciting features in our upcoming versions! ü§ò
</div>

### üåü Explore More with the Video Object

The `Video` object offers various methods that can be useful.

#### Access Transcript

```python
# Words with timestamps
text_json = video.get_transcript()
text = video.get_transcript_text()
print(text)
```

#### Access Visual Scene Descriptions

```python
# Take a look at the scenes
video.get_scene_index(index_id)
```

#### Add Subtitles to a Video

Add subtitles to a video and instantly generate a new stream. The subtitle function offers styling parameters such as font, size, and background color. See the [Subtitle Styles](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/Subtitle.ipynb) notebook for details.

```python
new_stream = video.add_subtitle()
play_stream(new_stream)
```

#### Generate a Video Thumbnail

Use `video.generate_thumbnail(time=)` to generate a thumbnail image from a specific timestamp (in seconds).

```python
from IPython.display import Image

image = video.generate_thumbnail(time=12.0)
Image(url=image.url)
```

##### Delete a video :

*   `video.delete()`: Deletes a video.

```python
video.delete()
```

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">

## Adding Subtitles
---

This guide demonstrates how to customize subtitle styles using the `SubtitleStyle` class.  We'll explore various configurations with **visual examples**, covering:

*   Typography and Style
*   Color and Effects
*   Positioning and Margins
*   Text Transformation
*   Borders and Shadow

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
---

### üì¶ Installing the VideoDB Package

```python
%pip install videodb
```

### üîë API Key

To use this notebook, you'll need a [VideoDB](https://videodb.io) API key.

> Get your API key from the [VideoDB Console](https://console.videodb.io). (Free for the first 50 uploads, **no credit card required!** üéâ)

```python
import os
os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = ""
```

### üåê Connect to VideoDB

```python
from videodb import connect

conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
```

### üé• Upload Video

Let's upload a video to which we'll add subtitles.  We'll use this sample video for demonstration.

```python
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il39Ks4mV9g")
video.play()
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  You can also upload videos from your local file system by passing the `file_path` argument to the `upload()` method.

## üîä Index Spoken Words
---

Before adding subtitles, we need to index the spoken words in the video using `video.index_spoken_words()`. This process generates the video transcript.

```python
video.index_spoken_words()
```

## üìù Default Subtitles
---

The `Video.add_subtitle()` method adds subtitles to your video using default styles.

This method returns a streaming link, which you can play using the `play_stream()` function.

```python
from videodb import play_stream

# Add Subtitle to Video
stream_url = video.add_subtitle()

# Play stream
play_stream(stream_url)
```

## üìù Custom Styled Subtitles
---

To customize subtitle styles, pass a `SubtitleStyle` object (with your desired configurations) to the `Video.add_subtitle()` method.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Refer to the API Reference for the `SubtitleStyle` class for a complete list of available options.

### 1. Typography and Style

Configure the typography of your subtitles by setting the following parameters within the `SubtitleStyle()` class:

*   `font_name`: The font name (e.g., "Roboto").
*   `font_size`: The font size in pixels.
*   `spacing`:  Spacing in pixels between characters.
*   `bold`: Set to `True` for bold text.
*   `italic`: Set to `True` for italic text.
*   `underline`: Set to `True` for underlined text.
*   `strike_out`: Set to `True` for strike-through text.

```python
from videodb import SubtitleStyle

stream_url = video.add_subtitle(
    SubtitleStyle(
        font_name="Roboto",
        font_size=12,
        spacing=0,
        bold=False,
        italic=False,
        underline=False,
        strike_out=False,
    )
)
play_stream(stream_url)
```

![](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/subtitle-style/typography.png)

### 2. Color and Effects

Customize the color of your subtitles by configuring these parameters in the `SubtitleStyle()` class:

*   `primary_colour`:  The main subtitle text color.
*   `secondary_colour`: The color for karaoke effects or secondary text.
*   `outline_colour`:  The color of the text outline.
*   `back_colour`:  The background color behind the subtitle.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Color Format**
>
> `SubtitleStyle` expects colors in the `&HBBGGRR` hexadecimal format. The sequence represents blue, green, and red components, and the `&H` prefix is required.
>
> For transparency, add an alpha value at the beginning: `&HAABBGGRR`.

```python
from videodb import SubtitleStyle

stream_url = video.add_subtitle(
    SubtitleStyle(
        primary_colour="&H00A5CFFF",
        secondary_colour="&H00FFFF00",
        outline_colour="&H000341C1",
        back_colour="&H803B3B3B",
    )
)
play_stream(stream_url)
```

![](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/subtitle-style/colors.png)

### 3. Position and Margins

Adjust the alignment and position of your subtitles using these `SubtitleStyle()` parameters:

*   `alignment`: Subtitle alignment.  Accepts a value of type `SubtitleAlignment`.
*   `margin_l`: Sets the left margin of the subtitle box.
*   `margin_r`: Sets the right margin of the subtitle box.
*   `margin_v`: Sets the top and bottom margins of the subtitle box.

Transform the text size and rotation by specifying these parameters in `SubtitleStyle()`:

*   `scale_x`: Horizontal scaling factor.
*   `scale_y`: Vertical scaling factor.
*   `angle`: Rotation angle in degrees.

```python
from videodb import SubtitleStyle

stream_url = video.add_subtitle(
    SubtitleStyle(
        scale_x=1.5,
        scale_y=3,
        angle=0,
    )
)
play_stream(stream_url)
```

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/guides/Cleanup.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This notebook PERMANENTLY DELETES media files from your VideoDB account.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

üö® **IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, meticulously review the media files within your collections. Deletion is irreversible.** üö®

This guide outlines how to delete media files and manage storage within your VideoDB account. You'll learn how to:

*   Delete videos.
*   Remove audio files.
*   Remove images.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have your VideoDB API key.

```python
%pip install videodb
```

```python
import os
from videodb import connect

os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key

conn = connect()
```

---

## Reviewing Your Collections

First, let's inspect the collections and the number of assets they contain.

```python
colls = conn.get_collections()

print(f"There are {len(colls)} collections.")
print()

for coll in colls:
    videos = coll.get_videos()
    audios = coll.get_audios()
    images = coll.get_images()

    print(f"Collection '{coll.name}' (id: {coll.id})")
    print(f"  - Videos: {len(videos)}")
    print(f"  - Audio: {len(audios)}")
    print(f"  - Images: {len(images)}")
    print()
```

---

## Specifying the Target Collection

Enter the ID of the collection you want to clean up. **Double-check this ID before proceeding.**

```python
collection_id = "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID_HERE"  # Replace with the ID of the collection you want to clean
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Videos in the Collection

**THIS ACTION IS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE.  Ensure you have a backup if needed.**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
videos = coll.get_videos()

for video in videos:
    video.delete()
    print(f"Deleted video: {video.name} (ID: {video.id})")
print("All videos deleted from the collection.")
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Audio Files in the Collection

**THIS ACTION IS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE. Ensure you have a backup if needed.**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
audios = coll.get_audios()

for audio in audios:
    audio.delete()
    print(f"Deleted audio: {audio.name} (ID: {audio.id})")
print("All audio files deleted from the collection.")
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Images in the Collection

**THIS ACTION IS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE. Ensure you have a backup if needed.**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
images = coll.get_images()

for image in images:
    image.delete()
    print(f"Deleted image: {image.name} (ID: {image.id})")
print("All images deleted from the collection.")
```
```
Key improvements and explanations:

* **Stronger Warnings:** The warnings are now bolder and more direct, emphasizing the irreversible nature of the actions.  Phrases like "PERMANENTLY DELETES" and "THIS ACTION IS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE" are used repeatedly.
* **Clearer Instructions:** Instructions are more precise, explicitly telling the user to replace placeholders with their actual API key and collection ID.
* **Improved Readability:** Added horizontal lines (`---`) for better visual separation of sections.
* **Reinforced Verification:**  The notebook stresses the importance of double-checking the collection ID *before* executing any deletion commands.
* **Concise Descriptions:** Removed redundant phrases and unnecessary words.
* **Consistent Formatting:**  Made the print statements consistent (e.g., "Deleted video: {video.name} (ID: {video.id})").
* **Confirmation Messages:** Added confirmation messages after each deletion loop ("All videos deleted from the collection.") to provide clear feedback to the user.
* **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated the redundant repetition of descriptions for video, audio, and images deletion.
* **Focus on Irreversibility:** The warning message is more prominent and placed before each delete section.
* **API key instruction:** The comment `# Replace with your actual API key` guides the user to replace the placeholder.
* **More Specific Error Message/Instructions:** Added instructions about providing a backup for the content being deleted.
* **Grammar and Style:** Improved the overall grammar, style and word choice of the text, increasing clarity and professionalism.

## Text Assets: Overlaying Text on Videos

This guide introduces you to `TextAssets` in VideoDB, demonstrating how to add and customize text overlays on your videos. We'll cover:

*   Creating `TextAssets` with default styling.
*   Customizing text appearance: fonts, colors, borders, and background boxes.
*   Adding shadows to text.
*   Positioning and aligning text elements.

## Setup

### üì¶ Installing the VideoDB Package

Install the VideoDB Python package using pip:

```python
%pip install videodb
```

### üîë Connecting to VideoDB

Before you begin, you'll need a VideoDB API key.

> Get your API key from the [VideoDB Console](https://console.videodb.io).  It's free for the first 50 uploads and **no credit card is required!** üéâ

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```python
import os

os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = "" #@param {type:"string"}
```

Connect to VideoDB and retrieve a collection:

```python
from videodb import connect

conn = connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
```

### üé• Uploading a Video

VideoDB uses videos as the base for creating timelines. [Learn more about Timelines and Assets](https://docs.videodb.io/timeline-and-assets-44).

Upload a video to your collection:

```python
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4NEOTvstAc")
video.play()
```

## Creating Assets

Now, let's create the assets we'll use in our video timeline.  We'll need a base `VideoAsset` and several `TextAssets` with different styles.

*   `VideoAsset`: The source video for the timeline.
*   `TextAsset`:  The text elements we'll overlay.

> Learn more about [Timelines and Assets](https://docs.videodb.io/timeline-and-assets-44)

### üé• VideoAsset

Create a `VideoAsset` from the video you uploaded. This example uses the first 60 seconds of the video.

```python
from videodb.asset import VideoAsset

video_asset = VideoAsset(
  asset_id = video.id,
  start = 0,
  end = 60
)
```

### üî† TextAsset: Default Styling

To create a `TextAsset` with default styling, simply provide the text and duration.

*   `text` (required): The text to display.
*   `duration` (optional): How long the text appears (in seconds).

```python
from videodb.asset import TextAsset

text_asset_1 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5
)
```

![Default TextAsset Style](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/text-asset/default_style.png)

### üî° TextAsset: Custom Styling

To customize a `TextAsset`'s appearance, use the `style` parameter with a `TextStyle` instance.

*   `style` (optional):  A `TextStyle` object containing styling configurations.

> View the API Reference for [`TextStyle`](link to TextStyle API documentation)

**1. Font Styling**

Control font properties like family, size, color, and border.

```python
from videodb.asset import TextAsset, TextStyle

text_asset_2 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        font = "Inter",
        fontsize = 50,
        fontcolor = "#FFCFA5",
        bordercolor = "#C14103",
        borderw = "2",
        box = False
    )
)
```

![TextAsset with Font Styling](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/text-asset/font_styling.png)

**2. Configuring Background Box**

Add and style a background box behind the text.

```python
from videodb.asset import TextAsset, TextStyle

text_asset_3 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        box = True,
        boxcolor = "#FFCFA5",
        boxborderw = 10,
        boxw = 0,
        boxh = 0,
    )
)
```

![TextAsset with Background Box](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/text-asset/background_box.png)

**3. Configuring Shadows**

Add a shadow to your text to make it stand out.

```python
from videodb.asset import TextAsset, TextStyle

text_asset_4 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        shadowcolor="#0AA910",
        shadowx="2",
        shadowy="3",
    )
)
```

![TextAsset with Shadow](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-cookbook-assets/raw/main/images/guides/text-asset/custom_shadow.png)

**4. Position and Alignment**

Control the placement and alignment of the text within the video frame.  `x` and `y` coordinates define the location, while `text_align` and `y_align` control the alignment within the specified box.

```python
from videodb.asset import TextAsset, TextStyle

text_asset_5 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        x = 50,
        y = 50,
        y_align = "text",
        text_align = "T+L",
        boxcolor="#FFCFA5",
        boxh=100,
        boxw=600
    )
)

text_asset_6 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        x = 50,
        y = 50,
        y_align = "text",
        text_align = "M+C",
        boxcolor="#FFCFA5",
        boxh=100,
        boxw=600
    )
)

text_asset_7 = TextAsset(
    text="THIS IS A SENTENCE",
    duration=5,
    style=TextStyle(
        x = 50,
        y = 50,
        y_align = "text",
        text_align = "B+R",

### üéº Create a Timeline

Now, combine the `VideoAsset` and `TextAssets` into a timeline.  The `add_inline` method adds the video as the base, and `add_overlay` adds the text overlays at specific timestamps.

```python
from videodb.timeline import Timeline

# Initialize a Timeline
timeline = Timeline(conn)

# Add Our base VideoAsset inline
timeline.add_inline(video_asset)

# TextAsset with default Styling
timeline.add_overlay(0, text_asset_1)

# TextAsset with Custom Font Styling
timeline.add_overlay(5, text_asset_2)

# TextAsset with Custom Border Box
timeline.add_overlay(10, text_asset_3)

# TextAsset with Custom Shadow
timeline.add_overlay(15, text_asset_4)

# TextAsset with Custom Position and alignment
timeline.add_overlay(20, text_asset_5)
timeline.add_overlay(25, text_asset_6)
timeline.add_overlay(30, text_asset_7)
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play the Video

Generate a streaming URL from the timeline and play the video with overlays.

```python
from videodb import play_stream

stream_url = timeline.generate_stream()
play_stream(stream_url)
```
