# 📌 VideoDB F1 Race Search Pipeline: Turn Detection & Metadata Filtering

# [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/video-db/videodb-cookbook/blob/main/quickstart/scene_level_metadata_indexing.ipynb)

# 🎯 Objective

# This notebook demonstrates how to use VideoDB for **scene-level metadata filtering** to enable precise search and retrieval within an F1 race video.

# 🔍 What We’re Doing:

# ✔ Upload an **F1 race video**
# ✔ **Extract scenes** at 2-second intervals (1 frame per scene)
# ✔ **Describe scenes** using AI to generate metadata
# ✔ **Index scenes** with structured metadata (`camera_view` & `action_type`)
# ✔ **Search scenes** using **semantic search combined with metadata filtering**

# 📦 Install VideoDB SDK

# Installs the VideoDB SDK, required for connecting and processing video data.

```python
!pip install videodb

# 🔍 Generating Scene Metadata

# To **make scenes searchable**, AI is used to **describe & categorize** each scene with structured metadata:

# **📌 Scene-Level Metadata Fields:**
# 1️⃣ `camera_view` → **Where is the camera placed?**
#    - `"road_ahead"` → Driver’s **POV looking forward**
#    - `"helmet_selfie"` → Close-up of **driver’s helmet**

# 2️⃣ `action_type` → **What is the driver doing?**
#    - `"clear_road"` → No cars ahead (clean lap)
#    - `"chasing"` → Following another car (intense racing moment)

# **🚀 Why This Matters**
# - **Metadata filtering** allows us to **search for specific race scenarios.**
# - **Combining metadata & semantic search** makes retrieval **highly precise**.
