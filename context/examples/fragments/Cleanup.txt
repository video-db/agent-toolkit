‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This notebook will permanently delete media files from your VideoDB account.  Data loss is irreversible.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

üö® **IMPORTANT:  Before proceeding, carefully review the media files you intend to delete. This action cannot be undone.** üö®

This guide explains how to remove media files and reclaim storage space within your VideoDB account. It covers:

*   Deleting videos
*   Deleting audio files
*   Deleting images

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

---

Before you begin, ensure you have your [VideoDB](https://videodb.io) API key available.

```python
%pip install videodb
```

```python
import os
from videodb import connect

os.environ["VIDEO_DB_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"  # Replace with your actual API key

conn = connect()
```

## Review Collections

---

This section displays information about your collections and the number of media assets within each.

```python
colls = conn.get_collections()

print(f"Found {len(colls)} collections:\n")

for coll in colls:
    videos = coll.get_videos()
    audios = coll.get_audios()
    images = coll.get_images()

    print(f"Collection Name: '{coll.name}' (ID: {coll.id})")
    print(f"  - Videos : {len(videos)}")
    print(f"  - Audio  : {len(audios)}")
    print(f"  - Images : {len(images)}\n")
```

## Select the Target Collection

---

Specify the ID of the collection you wish to clean up.

```python
collection_id = "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID_HERE"  # Replace with the ID of the collection you want to clean.
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Videos

---

**Irreversibly deletes all videos from the selected collection.  Use with extreme caution!**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
videos = coll.get_videos()

for video in videos:
    video.delete()
    print(f"Deleted video: {video.name} (ID: {video.id})")
print("Video deletion complete.")
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Audio

---

**Irreversibly deletes all audio files from the selected collection. Use with extreme caution!**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
audios = coll.get_audios()

for audio in audios:
    audio.delete()
    print(f"Deleted audio: {audio.name} (ID: {audio.id})")
print("Audio deletion complete.")
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Images

---

**Irreversibly deletes all images from the selected collection. Use with extreme caution!**

```python
coll = conn.get_collection(collection_id)
images = coll.get_images()

for image in images:
    image.delete()
    print(f"Deleted image: {image.name} (ID: {image.id})")
print("Image deletion complete.")
```
