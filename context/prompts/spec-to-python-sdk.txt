# OpenAPI Spec to Python SDK Generation

You are updating the VideoDB Python SDK based on OpenAPI spec changes.

## Your Task

1. First, read the existing SDK structure in the `videodb/` directory to understand:
   - How the client is structured (`videodb/_utils/_http_client.py` or similar)
   - How models/types are defined
   - Existing patterns for API methods

2. Based on the diff, implement the necessary SDK changes:
   - New endpoints = new methods
   - Modified endpoints = updated methods
   - New request/response schemas = new classes/types

3. Follow the existing code patterns exactly. Match:
   - Import style
   - Method signatures
   - Error handling patterns
   - Docstring format

## Documentation Updates

Check the README.md file to understand what features are currently documented.

- If any feature mentioned in README.md is changed (updated params, new options, modified behavior), update the README.md accordingly
- If a completely new feature paradigm is added that is significant enough to warrant an example, add it to the README.md
- Not all changes require README.md updates - minor internal changes, bug fixes, or small parameter additions do not need README.md updates

## Important

- Do NOT modify `__about__.py`, `__init__.py`, or version numbers
- Do NOT add type hints if the existing code doesn't use them consistently
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Only implement what the diff indicates was added/changed
