# Python SDK to Node SDK Generation

You are updating the VideoDB Node SDK to match changes made to the Python SDK.

## Python SDK Available (READ-ONLY)

The complete Python SDK is available at `./python-sdk/videodb/` for you to read.
You have FULL ACCESS to read any Python file to understand the complete context.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The `python-sdk/` directory is READ-ONLY for reference.
- DO NOT write, modify, or create any files in `python-sdk/`
- DO NOT attempt to commit or push changes to the Python SDK
- ONLY read from `python-sdk/` to understand the source code
- ONLY write to the Node SDK files in `src/`

## File Mapping: Python SDK → Node SDK

| Python File | Node File | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `videodb/client.py` | `src/core/connection.ts` | Main client/connection class |
| `videodb/collection.py` | `src/core/collection.ts` | Collection operations |
| `videodb/video.py` | `src/core/video.ts` | Video class and methods |
| `videodb/audio.py` | `src/core/audio.ts` | Audio class and methods |
| `videodb/image.py` | `src/core/image.ts` | Image class and methods |
| `videodb/scene.py` | `src/core/scene.ts` | Scene class |
| `videodb/shot.py` | `src/core/shot.ts` | Shot class |
| `videodb/timeline.py` | `src/core/timeline.ts` | Timeline class |
| `videodb/search.py` | `src/core/search/` | Search functionality |
| `videodb/_constants.py` | `src/constants.ts` | Constants and enums |
| `videodb/_utils/` | `src/utils/` | Utility functions |
| Type definitions | `src/types/` | TypeScript interfaces |

## Your Task

1. **Identify which Python files changed** in the diff
2. **Read the FULL Python file** from `./python-sdk/videodb/` to understand:
   - The complete context of the change
   - What class/enum/function the change belongs to
   - The surrounding code structure
3. **Find the corresponding Node SDK file** using the mapping table
4. **Read the Node SDK file** to understand current patterns
5. **Replicate the exact same changes** in the Node SDK file:
   - If a new method was added in Python, add the equivalent method in Node
   - If a constant was added, add it to the same location in constants.ts
   - If a new class was added, create the corresponding TypeScript class
   - If parameters were added/changed, update the Node version accordingly

IMPORTANT: Always read the full Python source file, not just the diff, to understand WHERE and HOW to add the code.

## Translation Rules

| Python | TypeScript |
|--------|------------|
| `str` | `string` |
| `int`, `float` | `number` |
| `bool` | `boolean` |
| `None` | `null` or `undefined` |
| `Optional[X]` | `X \| undefined` or `X?` |
| `List[X]` | `X[]` |
| `Dict[str, X]` | `Record<string, X>` |
| `def method(self, ...)` | `async method(...): Promise<...>` |
| `@dataclass class Foo` | `interface Foo { ... }` |
| `snake_case` | `camelCase` |
| `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (keep same for constants) |

## Node SDK Patterns

- Methods that call the API should be `async` and return `Promise<T>`
- Use the existing `this.connection.post()` / `this.connection.get()` patterns
- Types go in `src/types/` directory
- Exports are managed in `src/index.ts`

## Important

- Do NOT modify `package.json`, `version.ts`, or version numbers
- Do NOT change existing exports unless adding new ones
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- ONLY implement what the diff indicates was added/changed
- Convert `snake_case` to `camelCase` for methods and variables
- Keep `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
