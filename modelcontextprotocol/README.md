To add the MCP server in any config driven MCP Client, following is how the commands and arguments will look like

## Install `uv`
We need to install uv first.

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Run the MCP Server
You can run the MCP server using `uvx` using the following command

```
uvx videodb-director-mcp --api-key=VIDEODB_API_KEY
```
